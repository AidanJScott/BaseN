This program is a demonstration of some concepts from my discrete math class.
Not everything is necessarily the most efficient, in fact, I will often take a
longer route to show the by-hand method as a restriction for myself.

As for a bit more of a timeline of this project. I started this program with the only 
function in mind being to take a decimal number and change it into a number of any other base. 
As we learned more concepts in my discrete class, I kept wanting to add more.
At first I tried to just expand my original program as-is. This didn't work. 
I realized that I needed to scrap everything due to the sloppy organization and start over. 
I decided to make a document to plan out everything that I needed for each function, and the functions needed for those functions. 
After all of that, I spent a good weekend rewriting the stuff I have written in the previous 
attempt and also writing the new code that I had not written yet. 
I enjoyed the challenge of writing the biggest of my own programs yet while keeping it organized. 

I have also added a version for Windows OS that clears the screen when it reprints the menu for better formatting
